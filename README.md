My name is Victor Granlund, and I am (currently spring 2021) finishing my studies in Cold Climate engineering, specializing in offshore structures, the arctic, and ship construction. 
To me, coding is a useful and enjoyable tool. I enjoy participating in hackathons and coding challenges. 
My programming background is limited to mostly MATLAB and Python.
